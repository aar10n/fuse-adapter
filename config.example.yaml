  # S3 bucket mount example
  - path: /mnt/s3-data
    connector:
      type: s3
      bucket: my-data-bucket
      region: us-east-1
      # Optional: prefix all keys with this path
      prefix: "sandbox/"
      # Optional: custom endpoint for S3-compatible stores (MinIO, LocalStack)
      # endpoint: "http://localhost:9000"
      # Optional: force path-style URLs (required for some S3-compatible stores)
      # force_path_style: true
    cache:
      type: filesystem
      path: /var/cache/fuse-adapter/s3-data
      # max_size: 1GB  # Not yet implemented
      # flush_interval: 30s  # Not yet implemented

  # Read-only S3 mount with memory cache
  - path: /mnt/s3-readonly
    connector:
      type: s3
      bucket: public-datasets
      region: us-west-2
    cache:
      type: memory
      max_entries: 1000

  # S3 mount without caching (not recommended for write operations)
  - path: /mnt/s3-direct
    connector:
      type: s3
      bucket: temp-storage
      region: us-east-1
